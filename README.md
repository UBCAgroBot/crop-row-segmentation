## Crop Row Image Segmentation

**Details:** this project involves segmenting an image to distinguish crop rows. Whether we use a computer vision approach or a deep learning approach (U-net) is up to the team and the data available. This model will be built from scratch â€“ expect a lot of work with tensor shapes, reading articles, running small experiments.

**Team size:** 3

**Progression:** 
- gathering dataset 
- creating a U-net for a commonly used dataset (like ImageNet) 
- cleaning the data
- making U-net work on crop row dataset 
- tuning hyperparameters

**Technologies:** Pytorch, Python, (maybe a little bit of W&B if we have time at the end)
